Introduction
====

matrecorder watches as you collect materials and tells you information
about those materials - so you can tell when you are getting full and 
what grade of materials you have found.

Now with added understanding of material trading / crafting so that it should
take these into account when working out what materials you have available.

The running counts of what you are collecting reset when you drop out of 
supercuise so that you should only see materials you are collecting from 
your current location. 

Prerequistes
----

You will need EDMC installed https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki

Installation
----

Unzip the plugin into EDMCs plugins directory. It appears as a plugin called
matrecorder-master. 

Usage
----

Just collect mats - the windows will show the last 5, along with how many you 
have and what grade they are. The Grade (G1-G5) is the one that is shown in 
the material traders, not the one shown in your inventory - they differ 
slightly.
