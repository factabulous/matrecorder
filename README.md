Introduction
====

matrecorder watches as you collect materials and tells you information
about those materials - so you can tell when you are getting full and 
what grade of materials you have found.


Prerequistes
----

You will need EDMC installed https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector/wiki

Installation
----

Unzip the plugin into EDMCs plugins directory. It appears as a plugin called
matrecorder-master. 

Usage
----

Just collect mats - the windows will show the last 5, along with how many you 
have and what grade they are. The Grade (G1-G5) is the one that is shown in 
the material traders, not the one shown in your inventory - they differ 
slightly.
